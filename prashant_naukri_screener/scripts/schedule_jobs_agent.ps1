# -Mode scan   (default) finds jobs and writes the tracker page. Sends nothing.

# Switching mode re-registers the tasks, so you never end up with both running.
#
# The times are deliberately off the hour. Every scheduler on the planet fires
# at :00, and a run that always starts exactly at 09:00 is a more obvious
# pattern than one that starts at 08:52.
#
# The tasks run interactively (not "whether user is logged on or not") on
# purpose: both boards serve blocked pages to headless Chromium, so the agent
# needs a real desktop session to draw a browser into. A visible browser window
# will open while each run works.

    #          afternoon never overwrites the morning. Costs model tokens -
    #          roughly $5-6 for the first run of a day, less for later runs
    #          where the Top 10 has barely moved and questions carry over.
    # apply    submit real applications. Read jobs_agent.bat before using it.
